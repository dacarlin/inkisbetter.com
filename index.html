        Enzyme design with generative ML 
      </a>
      <br><small>
        My primary interest currently is generative ML for protein design. I've previously led numerous protein AI projects at Ginkgo Bioworks—where I worked from 2017 to 2023—including benchmarking, scaling, and improving deep neural networks for protein design across dozens of enzyme classes.

        Insanely challenging protein design ML benchmarks
      </a>
      <br><small>This project advances the field of machine learning for protein engineering via the creation of a large, high-quality dataset of kinetic constants for designed enzymes. It includes a complete dry- and wet-lab course in computational protein design and enzyme kinetic characterization suitible for the undergraduate level</small>
